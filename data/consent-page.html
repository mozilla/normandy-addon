          <p><strong>If you agree</strong> to participate:</p>
          <ol>
          <li>We install <strong class="studyName"></strong>, an add-on that will make the Firefox browser more personal to your usage patterns.</li>
          <li>Continue using Firefox as you normally would. You may notice changes.</li>
          <li>After <span class="duration"></span>, the study will end on its own. Your Firefox will go back to normal.</li>
          <li>We will ask you to fill out a quick <strong>optional survey</strong> to tell us about your experience. The survey should take less than 5 minutes to complete.</li>
          </ol>
          <h2 id="leaving-the-study">Leaving the study</h2>
          <p>The study will expire on its own in <span class="duration"></span>.  You may leave the study early.  To do so, follow these steps:</p>
          <ol>
          <li>Type <code>about:addons</code> into the location bar, and press enter.</li>
          <li>Find <code class="studyName"></code> in the <strong>extensions</strong> list pane.</li>
          <li>Click the <code>remove</code> button.</li>
          <li>If you opt out of the study early we will ask you to fill out a survey. We’re interested in hearing about your experience, even if you didn’t participate in the entire study.</li>
          </ol>
          <p>Opting out of a study does not prevent you from participating in future studies.</p>

          <p>Every Shield Study collects data about important study events, such as install, uninstall, daily usage, and end of study. Studies also include an optional survey.</p>
          <p>This data is associated with <a href="https://gecko.readthedocs.io/en/latest/toolkit/components/telemetry/telemetry/index.html">Firefox Telemetry collection</a>.</p>
          <h3 id="this-particular-study">This Particular Study</h3>
          <p>In addition to the data collected by all Shield Studies and your voluntary answers to the followup survey, here are the <strong>key things you should know</strong> about what is happening when you participate in this study:</p>
          <ul>
          <li>We collect basic usage data regarding your interaction with the experimental add-on.</li>
          <li>We collect data around your visits to <a href="https://github.com/mozilla/addon-recommendation-shield-study/blob/master/sites.txt">certain popular websites</a> in order to provide a more customized Firefox experience.</li>
          <li>As you would expect, we do not collect any information when you are in private browsing mode.</li>
          </ul>
